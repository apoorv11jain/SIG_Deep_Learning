#Python Standard Library Module Names
'''Python is rich with library modules which comes out of the box
. A common mistake is using the same name for a module and a module in the 
Python standard library. This will lead to importing another library which will 
then try to import the module in the Python standard library and since there 
will be a module with the same name, the other package will import the defined module,
in place of the Python standard library module.'''
